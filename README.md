# CryptoSplit

## About

Introducing an amazing decentralized application (Dapp) that simplifies the way you manage your shared expenses with your friends and family. This Dapp operates on the same principles as Splitwise, the popular expense sharing application, but with a unique twist. It handles cryptocurrencies in ERC20 tokens!

With the rise of digital currencies, managing shared expenses in cryptocurrencies has become increasingly common. However, there is currently no mainstream platform that allows users to efficiently and securely split expenses with their peers in a decentralized manner. This is where my Dapp comes in.

CryptoSplit provides a safe and seamless way to split expenses with your contacts in cryptocurrency, removing the need for cumbersome manual calculations and transfers. The platform is built on blockchain technology, which means that it is transparent, secure, and immutable.

With CryptoSplit, you can easily create groups, add expenses, and split them fairly among the members. The app automatically tracks who owes what and settles balances with just a few clicks. You can also keep a record of all transactions on the blockchain, ensuring that all participants have a transparent view of the group's finances.

Whether you're splitting rent, groceries, or travel expenses, CryptoSplit makes it easy to manage shared expenses in cryptocurrency, without the hassle of traditional payment methods. Give it a try and experience the future of decentralized expense sharing!
